# Perl Quota module

This repository contains the sources of the Perl "Quota" module, which has its
official home at [https://metacpan.org/pod/Quota](https://metacpan.org/pod/Quota).
Please use the ticket interfaces at CPAN for reporting issues.

The Perl Quota module provides access to file system quotas on UNIX platforms.
This works both for locally mounted file systems and network file systems (via
RPC, i.e. Remote Procedure Call). The interface is designed to be independent
of UNIX flavours as well as file system types.

I started developing this module while working as a UNIX system administrator
in 1995 (while being a CS student at university). Since then it was continually
improved and ported to more and more UNIX platforms and filesystems. Numerous
people have contributed to this process; for a complete list of names please
see the CHANGES document in the repository.

The quota module was in the public domain 1995 to 2001. Since 2001 it is
licensed under both the Perl Artistic License and version 2 or later of the GNU
General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation.  For a
